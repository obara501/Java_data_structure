# Data Structures in Java

Welcome to the "Data Structures in Java" repository! This repository provides examples of various data structures and sorting algorithms implemented in Java. Let's explore each of them briefly:

## Data Structures

### Arrays

An array is a collection of elements of the same type, accessed using indices. This repository includes examples of working with arrays, including operations like accessing elements, updating elements, inserting elements, deleting elements, and searching for elements.

### Stacks

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that allows adding and removing elements from the top. This repository includes examples of stack implementations, including the push, pop, peek, and isEmpty operations.

### Queues

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that allows adding elements to the rear and removing elements from the front. This repository includes examples of queue implementations, including enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty operations.

### Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure composed of nodes, where each node stores a value and a reference to the next node. This repository includes examples of linked list implementations, including adding elements at the head or tail, removing elements, and traversing the list.

### Binary Trees

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children. This repository includes examples of binary tree implementations, including insertion, deletion, searching, and traversing the tree.

### Red-Black Trees

A red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, where each node has an extra color attribute. This repository includes examples of red-black tree implementations, including insertion, deletion, searching, and balancing operations.

### Hash Tables

A hash table, or hash map, is a data structure that provides fast access to values using a key-value pair mapping. This repository includes examples of hash table implementations, including adding elements, retrieving values, and handling collisions.

### Heaps

A heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property, where each parent node has a value greater than or equal to its children. This repository includes examples of heap implementations, including insertion, deletion, and heapify operations.

### Graphs

A graph is a collection of nodes, called vertices, along with edges that connect these vertices. This repository includes examples of graph implementations, including adding vertices, adding edges, traversing the graph, and performing graph algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms

This repository also includes examples of various sorting algorithms implemented in Java:

- Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the array into two halves, sorts them independently, and merges them back.
- Insertion Sort: An in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.
- Selection Sort: A simple in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the array into sorted and unsorted portions and repeatedly selects the smallest element.

Feel free to explore the provided examples in this repository to gain a better understanding of data structures, sorting algorithms, and their practical applications.
